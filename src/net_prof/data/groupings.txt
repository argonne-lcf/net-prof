Counter_Group	Counter_Name	Counter_Description
CxiPerfStats	HNI_PKTS_SENT_BY_TC_<n>	Number of packets sent in traffic class <n>; 8 counters, default classes are 0 for request and 1 for response.
CxiPerfStats	HNI_PKTS_RECV_BY_TC_<n>	Number of packets received in traffic class <n>; 8 counters, default classes are 0 for request and 1 for response.
CxiPerfStats	HNI_TX_PAUSED_<n>	Number of cycles in which the transmit path is paused for traffic class <n>; default classes are 0 for request and 1 for response. Indicates that this endpoint is supplying data faster than the network can deliver it. Divide by 1E9 to determine the proportion of time paused.
CxiPerfStats	HNI_RX_PAUSED_<n>	Number of cycles in which the pause is applied on the receive path for traffic class <n>; default classes are 0 for request and 1 for response. Indicates that the network is supplying data faster than this endpoint can consume it. Divide by 1E9 to determine the proportion of time paused.
CxiPerfStats	PARBS_TARB_PI_POSTED_PKTS	Number of PCIe packets transferred using the posted path (for example, writes),
CxiPerfStats	PARBS_TARB_PI_POSTED_BLOCKED_CNT	and the number of cycles in which this path is blocked. Compute the ratio cycles/pkts. Values of more than a few cycles per packet indicate back pressure from the host. This endpoint is likely to be the cause of congestion.
CxiPerfStats	PARBS_TARB_PI_NON_POSTED_PKTS	Number of PCIe packets transferred using the non-posted path (for example,
CxiPerfStats	PARBS_TARB_PI_NON_POSTED_BLOCKED_CNT	reads), and the number of cycles in which this path is blocked. Compute the ratio cycles/pkts. Values of more than a few cycles per packet indicate per host performance (high read latencies). This endpoint is likely to be injecting at a low rate.
CxiPerfStats	LPE_NET_MATCH_PRIORITY_<n>	Number of messages matched on the priority list (or receive was posted before the message arrived). Four counters of which 0 is the default. These messages incur lower cost because data is written directly to the user buffer.
CxiPerfStats	LPE_NET_MATCH_OVERFLOW_<n>	Number of messages where payload data was delivered to a buffer on the overflow list because there was no match on the priority list. Four counters of which 0 is the default. These messages incur higher cost because data must be copied from the overflow buffer. Compute the ratio priority/(priority + overflow) to determine the porportion of messages for which receives were posted in advance.
CxiPerfStats	ATU_CACHE_MISS_<n>	Number of misses in the NIC translation cache. Four counters of which counter 0 counts misses on 4K pages and counter 1 counts misses on 2M pages by default.
CxiPerfStats	ATU_CACHE_EVICTIONS_<n>	Number of times a tag was evicted from the NIC translation cache to make room for a new tag.
CxiErrStats	PCT_SPT_TIMEOUTS	Number of response timeouts (or packet loss in the network).
CxiErrStats	PCT_SCT_TIMEOUTS	Retry handler is invoked.
CxiErrStats	PCT_NO_TCT_NACKS	Number of resource exhaustion NACKs. Retry handler is invoked.
CxiErrStats	PCT_NO_TRS_NACKS	NO_DESCRIPTION
CxiErrStats	PCT_NO_MST_NACKS	NO_DESCRIPTION
CxiErrStats	PCT_RETRY_SRB_REQUESTS	Number of retries.
CxiErrStats	PCT_TRS_RSP_NACK_DROPS	Number of NACKs dropped. Retry handler is invoked.
CxiErrStats	HNI_PCS_UNCORRECTED_CW	Number of uncorrected code words received on the switch to NIC link. High rates (multiple errors per second) indicate a poor quality link.
CxiErrStats	HNI_LLR_TX_REPLAY_EVENT	Number of LLR replays. High rates (multiple per second) indicate that the LLR
CxiErrStats	HNI_LLR_RX_REPLAY_EVENT	mechanism is providing protection on a poor quality link.
CxiOpCommands	CQ_DMA_CMD_COUNTS	Number of commands of each type: - Put, Get, rendezvous, atomics, small message, Ethernet, etc. - Target commands - Triggered operations Excluding the CMD_ETHERNET_TX command, Cassini supports the generation and sending of packets. 
CxiOpCommands	CQ_CQ_CMD_COUNTS	Both CQ commands (FENCE and LCID) and target commands:
CxiOpCommands	CQ_NUM_DMA_CMDS	Number of DMA commands.
CxiOpCommands	CQ_NUM_IDC_CMDS	Number of immediate data commands.
CxiOpPackets	HNI_TX_OK_<min>_to_<max>	Number of packets sent in each of 12 size bins: - Small packets 27, 35, 64 bytes - 65-128, 256-511, 512-1023, 1024-2047, 2048-4095, 4096-8191, 8192-Max
CxiOpPackets	HNI_RX_OK_<min>_to_<max>	Number of packets received in each of 12 size bins.
CxiOpPackets	HNI_PKTS_SENT_BY_TC	Number of packets sent in each traffic class; default classes or 0 and 1.
CxiOpPackets	HNI_PKTS_RECV_BY_TC	Number of packets received in each traffic class; default classes or 0 and 1.
